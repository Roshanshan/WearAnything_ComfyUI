# My Project

This project involves using a visual programming interface for image generation, potentially involving IPAdapters and CLIP text encoding.

## Overview

This project uses a combination of IPAdapters and CLIP text encoding to generate images based on textual prompts. The following components are utilized:

- **IPAdapter Unified Loader**: Loads IPAdapter models with different presets.
- **IPAdapter Advanced**: Advanced settings for IPAdapter, including weights, types, and embedding scaling.
- **Load Image**: Component to load an input image.
- **CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)**: Encodes text prompts into a format usable by the model.
- **KSampler**: Samples latent space to generate images.
- **VAE Decode**: Decodes the latent image back to a viewable image format.
- **Load Checkpoint**: Loads a pre-trained model checkpoint for generation.

## Components

### IPAdapter Unified Loader
- **Model**: Specifies the IPAdapter model to load.
- **Preset**: Selects the preset strength for the model.

### IPAdapter Advanced
- **Weight**: Sets the weight of the model.
- **Weight Type**: Determines how weights are combined.
- **Embed Scaling**: Adjusts scaling of embeddings.

### Load Image
Loads the input image for processing.

### CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)
- **Positive**: Encodes the positive prompt text.
- **Negative**: Encodes the negative prompt text.

### KSampler
- **Seed**: Random seed for generation.
- **Steps**: Number of steps for the sampling process.
- **Scheduler**: Scheduler type for sampling.

### VAE Decode
Decodes the latent space output to an image.

### Load Checkpoint
Loads the pre-trained model checkpoint.
